This mod aims to rebalance the Super Saiyan forms from the Dragon Ball Terraria and Dragon Ball Calamity Addon mods
by greatly toning down the damage, speed and defense bonuses granted by these forms. Ensuring that usage of these forms 
does not invalidate the challenges of the game. 


Although this mod supports Dragon Ball Calamity Add-on, it is not required to use this mod. Only Dragon Ball Terraria is required.
